## Specifications and uses of the ZILLA Utility Chain

Zilla Chain version 0.1.0 beta

"ZILLA" is the ticker for the ChainZilla token. ZILLA is a utility token, which gives our users access to the services provided by ChainZilla.io


## What is a utility token?

A utility token represents access to a future product or service. When you buy a utility token, you are buying your “right” to use a service that’s being developed by a project once it’s finished and launched. ChainZilla plans to extend the functionalities and implement them into the company structure and services we offer. 

## How may I use the ZILLA utility token?

ZILLA token holders are able to exchange their tokens for ChainZilla services such as Komodo notarizations, blockchain deployment, app & web development, and cyber security services. In addition we plan to establish strong governance over our operations, token holders will be able to participate in community votes when ChainZilla deems appropriate.

## About CHAINZILLA

ChainZilla was conceived with the purpose of raising the bar in terms of the quality of the applications and blockchains being used in the industry. Additionally, our goal is to facilitate the use of open source technology such as atomic swaps, native blockchain deployment, and smart contracts in different sectors. These fields includes real estate, finance, non-profit, and academic. Corporations are dedicating resources to find out how much business they can gain by adopting blockchain technology. Blockchain has the potential of a trans-formative technology. It allows solving two important issues, those of centralized trust and the speed of operations. Blockchain will not remain a purely fintech phenomenon and has set itself up for wider B2B applications in the coming decade. ChainZilla will play a major role in bringing blockchain technology to regions that are still in their infancy in regards to blockchain and fintech technology such as LATAM. 
## Getting started
Dependencies
------------
Install Komodo: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/en/latest/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-manually

After installing the Komodo repository, follow the steps:

`cd komodo/src`

# Now run the following command to start the ZILLA chain or TESTZILLA chain. 

# Mainnet
`./komodod -ac_name=ZILLA -ac_supply=11000000 -addnode=54.39.23.248 -gen &`

# Testnet
`./komodod -ac_name=TESTZILLA -ac_supply=11000000 -addnode=158.69.0.53 &`

Once the ZILLA chain is synched, you are able to use the wallet functionality

More details are available under https://komodoplatform.com/.

Deprecation Policy
------------------

This release is considered deprecated one year after the release day. There
is an automatic deprecation shutdown feature which will halt the node some
time after this one year period. The automatic feature is based on block
height and can be explicitly disabled.


**Komodo is unfinished and highly experimental, use at your own risk.**


Building
--------
Build Zcash along with most dependencies from source by running
`./zcutil/build.sh`. Currently only Linux is officially supported.

**NOTE TO EXCHANGES:**
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1605144.msg17732151#msg17732151
There is a small chance that an outbound transaction will give an error due to mismatched values in wallet calculations. There is a -exchange option that you can run komodod with, but make sure to have the entire transaction history under the same -exchange mode. Otherwise you will get wallet conflicts.

**To change modes:**

a) backup all privkeys (launch komodod with `-exportdir=<path>` and `dumpwallet`)

b) start a totally new sync including `wallet.dat`, launch with same `exportdir`

c) stop it before it gets too far and import all the privkeys from a) using `komodo-cli importwallet filename`

d) resume sync till it gets to chaintip

For example:
```shell
./komodod -exportdir=/tmp &
./komodo-cli dumpwallet example
./komodo-cli stop
mv ~/.komodo ~/.komodo.old && mkdir ~/.komodo && cp ~/.komodo.old/komodo.conf ~/.komodo.old/peers.dat ~/.komodo
./komodod -exchange -exportdir=/tmp &
./komodo-cli importwallet /tmp/example
```
